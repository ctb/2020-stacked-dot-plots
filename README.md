# Stacked dot plots

## an exploratory repository

Run [mashmap](https://github.com/marbl/MashMap) or
[nucmer](https://github.com/mummer4/mummer) to find alignments between
a query genome and one or more target genomes; plot, dot-plot style.

See [the source in `alignplot.py`](./alignplot.py) and
[the `dotplot` notebook](./dotplot.ipynb) for more info.

## examples

### Shared sequences (contamination?) between two Genbank genomes.

Here, the Rokubacterium (red, x axis) is probably contaminated by sequences
from the Acidobacterium (y axis coordinates).

### Shared sequences between a TARA MAG and a Genbank genome.

The TARA binned genome/MAG is on the y axis, the Genbank genome is on x in
red.

### Shared sequences between a TARA MAG and two Genbank genomes.


The TARA binned genome/MAG is on the y axis, the first Genbank genome
is on x in red, the second is on x in blue.
